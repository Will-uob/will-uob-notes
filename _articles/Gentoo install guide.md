Hello, and welcome to my Gentoo Installation Guide!
This will be a UEFI install on a Lenovo X230.

### Prerequisites
- A laptop which has hardware support for gentoo linux
- A livecd which you can boot (doesn't have to be the official gentoo livecd)
- Access to the [handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64).

### Partitions
