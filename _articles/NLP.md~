# Natural Language Processing: CH10 Fastbook Notes

Key difference between NLP and Images: NLP tends to train pretrained models on seperate tasks.

Self-supervised learning: we don't give labels to our model, just a lot of data. There are many uses for it, seen in [this article](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-13-self_supervised.html).
- jargon: Self-supervised learning: Training a model using labels that are embedded in the independent variable, rather than requiring external labels. For instance, training a model to predict the
next word in a text.
