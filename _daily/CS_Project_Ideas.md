# Ideas for computer science
All of my projects are going to be involving deep learning, since this is what intrests me the most.
They will all be using either Supervised learning, Transfer learning or Online machine learning,
perhaps a mixture of all 3. 

### Technologies

I'm already pretty deadset on my technologies, which are going to be:
- Pytorch and FastAI for the deep learning
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scipy for data science
- Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript for the website, though
  hugging faces will be used in the beginning for convenience / prototyping the model.

### Actual ideas
Since the data and type of neural net I'm going to use is dependent on the project, I need ideas.
Shit... I have none. :D

The best one I came up with is to generate music based on either
- Labels inputted by a user
- An image

but, no commited yet.

Another idea is to generate the PinYin based on someone inputting toned pinyin input, or characters,
though I have no idea how I'd be able to get the audio and labels for this. No idea.

Another would be to focus on something in education, for example automarkers or Q&A, though
this is still need to be thought about...

Overall, I'm glad I've still got a month before I need to start my project, XD
