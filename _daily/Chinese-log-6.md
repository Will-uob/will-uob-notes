# 拼音： 一些个声调

![This is an image of Chinese tones](/images/chinesetones.jpeg)

### 第一声调

You have to pronounce it higher than other tones. For example:
- 开车
- 吃饭
- 包子

### 第二声调

This is the rising tone, from a low to high voice. Examples include:
- 明天
- 男人
- 吃苹果
- 学中文

### 第三声调
This is a low tone that falls.[^1] It sounds creaky. For example:
- 喜欢
- 可以
- 考试

The 3rd tone and the 1st tone can be considered as opposites of eachother.

### 第四声调

This is the falling tone, from high to low voice. Examples include：
- 快乐
- 知道
- 眼影

And finally, for practicing all of them, we have:
- 一起出去运动

### 轻声

The neutral tone. To sound like a native, simply prolong the sound of the previous character. For
example:
- 桌子
- 巴巴
- 石头

[^1] Note that the full version of the 3rd tone, the falling-rising tone, is only pronounced:
     - In isolation,
     - At the end of a word or sentence, though this rule is often disregarded.
