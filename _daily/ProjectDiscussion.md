# New plan for AI project after discussion with people online
### The best idea
The best idea I have is the music generation app. It uses stable diffusion, a topic still being researched and in high demand, and a cool and niche usage of it no less. This project will also potentially lead
me to even more interesting projects in the future, which will be very entertaining. Furthermore, I can just slap the project onto a HuggingFace space with Gradio, which will, at the very least, give me a good
prototype.

The focus should be on understanding and implementing these algorithms with a high level API, trying to create a model that's state of the art. After that, I can begin to think of things like creating
a frontend, with either NodeJS or Flask, and how to improve the user experience.

Of course, with the limitations of stable diffusion in mind, I can create models to perform certain tasks. For example, we could have a model that just takes in a string, and then returns music based on
the description to the best of it's ability. But, I could also have a model that takes a song and amplifies certain instruments, or a model that adds complexity to a backgroud beat. These are just ideas
of course, and as I dive into the project I will see how possible they are to implement.

### Technologies
It seems that using HuggingFace and Gradio APIs, especially in the prototyping stages, is going to be the best bet. As for hosting the website itself, I can either use HuggingFace spaces or Flask to deploy the
website, so that other people can use it.

### The focus of this project
Will definitely be on researching and implementing methods of audio generation, and trying to create a state-of-the-art model. Hence, the programming should only really complement the research here. It might
seem like a herculean task, but I'm convinced that overtime I can create something that at least competently solves the solution.
