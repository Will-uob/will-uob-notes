# 拼音：Initials, Finals and Tones

The final lesson for 拼音 basics.

### Simple Finals
1. a - open mouth like your in pain?
2. o - Round lips like in "u" and then let go as air comes through
3. e - Not like "eh", similar to Czech uhhh
4. i - Squeeze a smile
5. u - This is similar to the English one
6. ü - This is similar to u, but in the starting position of “o”

The ordering is based on, given a final, where the tone mark should go. The only exceptions are
ui and ui, where the tone mark goes on the i.

### Initials

1. b,  p,  m,  f (o)
2. d,  t,  n,  l (e)
3. g,  k,  h     (e)
4. j,  q,  x     (i)
5. z,  c,  s     (i)
6. zh, ch, sh, r (i)

You've already got a tutorial for rows 4,5,6. Only difference from English otherwise is sometimes the
emphasis, like f and h being more harsh.

### Basic Finals
- ai, ei, ao, ou
- an, en, er
- ang, eng, ong

Look out for "ong", as it starts from the "o" mouth position, not like the English.

### Compound Finals
#### i part

- ia, iao, ie: Look out for ie, it's like (i + -e), where e is like "eh"
- iu, ian: Look out for iu, it's like (i + ou)
- in, iang
- ing, iong

#### u part

- ua, uo, uai: uai is like the word "kuai"
- ui: It's like (u + ei)
- uan, un, uang, ueng: Look out for un (u + en)

#### The ü part

- üe: Look out, sounds like (ü + -e)
- ün: Look out, sounds like (ü + en)
- üan: Look out for (ü + an)

### Tones
#### 3rd tone
3rd tone + 3rd tone = 2nd tone + 3rd tone

But, look out! This seems to only apply to individual words. For example:
- 3rd tone + 3rd tone + 3rd tone = 2nd tone + 2nd tone + 3rd tone: 小姐早
- 3rd tone + 3rd tone + 3rd tone = 3rd tone + 2nd tone + 3rd tone: 纸老虎

#### 不
We use the 2nd tone when preceeding the 4th tone. Otherwise, we use the 4th tone.

#### 一
We use the 1st tone when it's on it's own. Otherwise, we have two possibilities:
- We use the 2nd tone when preceeding the fourth tone,
- We use the 4th tone otherwise.
