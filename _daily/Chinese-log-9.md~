# 拼音：Initials, Finals and Tones

The final lesson for 拼音 basics.

### Simple Finals
1. a - open mouth like your in pain?
2. o - Round lips like in "u" and then let go as air comes through
3. e - Not like "eh", similar to Czech uhhh
4. i - Squeeze a smile
5. u - This is similar to the English one
6. ü - This is similar to u, but in the starting position of “o”

The ordering is based on, given a final, where the tone mark should go. The only exceptions are
ui and ui, where the tone mark goes on the i.
