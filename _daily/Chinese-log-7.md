### zh, ch, sh, r
- zh, ʈʂ
- ch, ʈʂʰ
- sh, ʂ
- r, $ʐ^{[b]}$

Tip: Place tongue on/near the ridge of the mouth. For zh and ch, block the air and then release.
For sh and r, don't block the air. Make sure that for ch, you use more air, and for r, you use
more of your vocal chords.

### j, q, x
- j, tɕ
- q, tɕʰ
- x, ɕ

My advice for all of them is to squeeze a smile before pronuncing them, with your tongue near your
teeth. For j and q, block the air, with more air added for q. For x, don't block the air.

### z, c, s
- z, ts
- c, tsʰ 	
- s, s

The s sound can be made in two ways, with the second preferred:
- Put tip of your tongue close to the upper front teeth, let the air through,
- Put your tongue blade close to your upper front teeth.

The same expected rules apply for z, c and s. Read the IPA.
